4. **Provide Feedback**: After receiving a hint, indicate whether it was helpful using the üëç or üëé buttons
   - This feedback helps the system adapt to your preferences and skill level
   - Gold borders highlight your preferred settings based on feedback
   - The system will occasionally suggest optimal settings for you

5. **Switch Hint Modes**: Right-click the "Suggest Move" button to toggle between:
   - AI-powered hints (default)
   - Traditional minimax algorithm suggestions (highlights the move on the board)

## Adaptive Learning

The hint system incorporates several smart features to adapt to your preferences:

- **Game Phase Detection**: Recognizes whether you're in the opening, middle game, or endgame
- **Skill Level Assessment**: Estimates your skill level based on which hints you find helpful
- **Prompt Customization**: Tailors AI prompts to include your preferences and game context
- **Preference Tracking**: Learns which hint types and difficulty levels work best for you
- **Variety Injection**: Occasionally introduces different hint styles to prevent repetitiveness

## Technical Notes

The hint system stores feedback data in `hint_feedback.json` and player profile data in `player_profile.json`. These files track:

- Hint effectiveness metrics
- Preferred hint types and difficulties
- Estimated skill level
- Game phase preferences
- Hint history

The system uses this data to continuously improve hint quality and tailor the experience to your specific needs.
